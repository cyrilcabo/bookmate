# bookmate
A Hotel-Booking web application.

BookMate is a simple hotel-booking site, with simple features. Upon visiting the site, you have 3 options: continue as guest (default), login with your user credentials, or register if you don't have one.

If you choose to continue as guest, you are given a random guest ID number, which will then be used to track your activities during your browser-session. During your session, all bookings you made, will be available (viewable) in the "bookings" page of the app. Thus, it is advisable that you also save your booking details, before ending your browser activity. Furthermore, the details you used on your first booking will also be made available throughout your whole session.

If you do register and login, all your bookings will be saved to your account, and you will be able to access it anytime. Moreover, if you have an account, you can set-up default user details to save you the trouble of having to type your details over again, when you make more bookings in the future. You can also change your password or delete your account if you so desire.

With regards to confirming bookings, you can either opt to pay at the property, or pay immediately with a card. Please do note that since this is a mock application, and the properties don't really exist, your card won't be charged, if you input a valid one.
