# bookmate
A Hotel-Booking site. 

BookMate is a simple hotel-booking site, with simple features. Upon visiting the site, you have 3 options: continue as guest (default), login with your user credentials, or register if you don't have one. 

If you choose to continue as guest, you are given a random guest ID number, which will then be used to track your activities during your browser-session. During your session, all bookings you made, will be available (viewable) in the "bookings" page of the app. Furthermore, the details you used on your first booking will also be made available throughout your whole session.

If you do register and login, all your bookings will be saved to your account, and you will be able to access it anytime. Moreover, if you have an account, you can set-up default user details to save you the trouble of having to type your details over again when you make more bookings in the future. You can also change your password or delete your account in the "accounts" page of the app.

Overall, with the app, you can search for locations you desire, then book a property within that location. It will also serve you with hot offers that the properties offer. 

Book a staycation at your favorite property with your trusted booking partner, BookMate!
